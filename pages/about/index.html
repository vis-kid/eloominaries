  <h3 class='about-header'>
    What is this project all about?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    This is a green blockchain technology podcast brought to you by eloom.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class='about-header'>
    What exactly?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    A semiweekly podcast that informs followers and fans around the globe about our company, provides industry news, shares our learnings and provides knowledge from experts we connect with. Along the way the podcast builds a trusting audience and a channel for potential users, customers and future hires. All while giving back to a community of developers, open source people and crypto nerds.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class='about-header'>
    Why are we doing this?
  </h3>

  <p>
    It's a simple win-win really: We get to learn something new, talk to experts and can effectively share this knowledge with our audience for free.
  </p>

  <br></br>
  
  <p>
  Sharing knowledge or insights, access to experts and providing lessons learned seems like a logical thing to do in times of the open source ethos weaving itself into any kind of digital business. Especially when other companies neglect transparency and the potential to educate their audience about their field of competence.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class='about-header'>
    What is the focus of eloominaries?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Not sure we even want to have a narrow focus. Conversations with interesting people and exploring cool technologies in the cryptocurrency / blockchain and green energy space is what we are curious about at the moment.
  </p>

  <h3 class='about-header'>
    Who do you wanna have on your show?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Guests can be high-profile thought leaders, upcoming innovators, programmers, startup founders, open source folks, partners, employees or whoever we find interesting and would like to learn more about.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class='about-header'>
    Why are episodes sometimes super short?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Simple: We wanna save you some time and focus more on the “essential” bits. As interesting as it can be, expect less industry insider chit chat from this format. Also we want to make it easy for you to skip parts of an interview you don’t care about and to fine-tune what you want to listen to.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class='about-header'>
    Why do you sometimes discuss super basic stuff?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    We see two reasons: First of all, basic concepts can sometimes become very interesting if you dive deep enough. Secondly, we all know how easy it is to forget that “basic stuff” can be hard for peeps starting out. Atm we feel decrypting the gobbledygooky parts for beginners / newbies is necessary for the goals we have in mind with this project.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class='about-header'>
    Listening to embedded SoundCloud tracks is not working on my mobile browser with Chrome?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Other people and myself included have already brought this to SoundCloud’s attention and I really don’t understand what’s taking them so long to fix a major bug like this. I’m sure this won’t be an issue for long (hopefully) and I can only recommend the obvious, namely using another mobile browser of your choice in the meantime.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class='about-header'>

  <h3 class='about-header'>
    Are you going to sell out with annoying ads and sponsorship?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    We might do some sponsoring or similar but we have no interest in stuffing stuff down peoples’ throats. Don’t worry, we don’t wanna become podcasting douches.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class='about-header'>
    I would like to send in my feedback?

    Any tips for yak shaving season?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    There is only one thing to do really: Have plenty of razor blades ready.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class='about-header'>
    Why is there an annoying cookiePolicy link on the SoundCloud album cover?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Good question, not the best design decision SoundCloud has made lately. Gotta ask them. The placement is really unfortunate. We can’t hide this text for you due to cross-domain access but we hate it so much that we installed a Chrome extension, Stylish, and added some styles ( .cookiePolicy { display: none; } ) to hide that nonsense via the extension.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class='about-header'>
    What did you use to build this project?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Middleman, Sass, Bourbon, Bourbon Neat, CoffeeScript.
