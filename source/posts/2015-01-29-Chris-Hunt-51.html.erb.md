<p class="show_notes_display"><b>Questions:</b><br>- How do you learn?<br>- Any mistakes to avoid while learning?<br>- In your opinion, does self-confidence play a big role for effective learning?<br>- How does your diet and exercise affect your learning?<br>- What were the biggest obstacles when you started learning to code?<br>- In general, how would you recommend newbies should learn to code these days?<br>- You have extensive experience with memorization techniques. I was wondering, besides remembering faces and names more easily, how else does it affect your mind? Do you have an easier time remembering facts when reading a book, do you need less time to remember new stuff you learn, is your mind more at ease?<br><br><b>Links:</b><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.chrishunt.co/">Chris Hunt</a><br>Chris Hunt on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/chrishunt">Twitter</a><br>Chris Hunt on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/chrishunt">GitHub</a><br>Chris Hunt’s podcast <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.healthyhacker.com/">Healthy Hacker</a><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://giantrobots.fm/98">Memorization techniques</a> (Podcast episode)<br>Chris Hunt’s <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfTryhTC8wY">talk</a>: <i>Secrets of a World Memory Champion</i></p>
