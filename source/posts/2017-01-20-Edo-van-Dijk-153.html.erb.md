### Questions:

- How would you describe the creative scene in Singapore and its attractiveness for startups?
- Are these startups in some regards already ahead of the curve or are many of them still in copy-paste mode?
- Is there also something happening that is new to the startup world? Is there something unique?
- It sounds a little bit like Singapore is like a massive startup in itself?
